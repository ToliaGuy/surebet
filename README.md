# Surebet
## What is surebet?
According to [https://betburger.com](https://www.betburger.com/newbies/what-is-surebet)
Surebet (arbitrage opportunity) – is a mathematically calculated arbitrage situation allowing making stakes on all the opposing outcomes of the competition in different bookmakers. You earn in spite of the outcome!

There are several reasons of arbitrage situation appearance, here are the main ones:
* Overstated odds as a result of bookmakers’ competition.
* Bookmakers can not keep track of one another's actions and give different odds.
* Bookmakers’ mistakes that lead to false odds output.

## Notes
I tried to improve on [Apiestas repo](https://github.com/franloza/apiestas). I started working on this project in 2021, but unfortunatelly after some time I became busy with my school, so I didn't have enough time to continually improve it so I had to ambandon it, hopefully someone will be inspired by my work and build something interesting.
P.S. At that time I didn't use git so unfortunatelly you can not go through development history.
